##📊 Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn using various machine learning models. The goal is to help financial institutions reduce non-performing assets (NPAs) by identifying at-risk customers in advance.

##🙋‍♀️ About Me
I’m an aspiring software developer and recent IT graduate with a passion for solving real-world problems using machine learning and web technologies.



##🚀 Features
Data importing and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy

Categorical encoding and missing value handling

Feature scaling and dimensionality reduction

Applied ML models:

 -Logistic Regression

 -K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

 -Gaussian Naive Bayes

 -Random Forest

 -Evaluation using accuracy score

 -Streamlit web app for user input and prediction display

## 🛠️ Tech Stack / Libraries Used
 -Python

 -Pandas, NumPy

 -scikit-learn

 -Streamlit

##📁 Dataset
Dataset used: churn_prediction.csv
Contains customer demographic and transaction data used to predict churn.

##🧠 ML Models
Each model was trained using a training/test split and evaluated using accuracy. The best-performing model was used in the Streamlit app for real-time prediction.

##🌐 Streamlit App
The project includes a simple Streamlit-based UI where users can input customer details and get a real-time prediction on churn status.
